## Overview

This project focuses on data analysis using the World Bank Database as the primary data source. Python data analysis libraries such as NumPy and Pandas are employed to process the data, involving aggregation, imputation, and cleaning. The project's main objective is to provide valuable insights into various areas of economics, demographics, sociology, and the environment by presenting data through interactive visualizations.

## Data Collection

- The data used in this project is collected from the World Bank Database, a reputable source for global socio-economic data.
- The dataset comprises a wide range of indicators covering diverse aspects of countries' economies, populations, societies, and environments.

## Data Processing

- Data processing is carried out using Python data analysis libraries, including NumPy and Pandas.
- Key data processing steps include aggregation, imputation of missing values, and data cleaning to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

## Project Goals

- The primary goal of this project is to empower users to explore and gain insights into various global metrics.
- The project offers a user-friendly interface with interactive visualizations and filtering options to allow users to delve deeper into the data.

## Interactive Visualizations

- The project leverages the Python Plotly library to create six different interactive charts.
- Users can seamlessly interact with these charts to explore and understand data trends and relationships.
- The visualizations are equipped with a variety of filters, enabling users to view the data at a more granular level.

## Charts Included

1. **Line Charts:** Show trends and changes over time.
2. **Heatmaps:** Depict correlations and patterns.
3. **Scatter Plots:** Display relationships between variables.
4. **Choropleth Maps:** Provide geographical insights.
